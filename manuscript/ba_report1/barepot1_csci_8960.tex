    \begin{abstract}

        This project proposes a differentially private image classification system using ResNet-20 with various
        optimizers, starting with Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) as a baseline.
        We aim to make incremental improvements with additional optimization techniques, exploring both non-private
        and DP versions of optimizers, and justifying our choices based on prior work and their potential
        to outperform others.
        The project will focus on achieving competitive accuracy while satisfying privacy guarantees.
        Additionally, we are investigating ways to enhance accuracy by modifying optimizer components,
        such as gradient clipping (potentially using techniques like automatic clipping).

    \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

    The increase in prevalence of machine learning models, especially in image classification,
    has coincided with concerns over privacy~\cite{papernot2022hyperparametertuningrenyidifferential}.
    Differential privacy (DP) specifically addresses these concerns by ensuring that models do not inadvertently leak sensitive
    information about individual data points.
    In this proposal, we will use the ResNet-20 model, which is well-suited for datasets like CIFAR-10~\cite{Idelbayev_ResNet20},
    and will implement and improve DP-SGD to achieve better privacy guarantees without significantly compromising accuracy.
